Assignment (Week 7)

The management of LearnMore University is planning to automate the University management system.
Therefore, Steve Wilkinson, the programmer, has decided to create a Java program that accepts the student details, such as the first name,
last name, age, courses enrolled, and student ID. In addition, he also needs to accept the employee details, such as first name,
last name, age, salary, department name, designation, and employee ID. Steve must ensure the reusability of code.
The program must offer a choice to accept either the student’s or the employee’s details. Help Steve to develop the program.
Note: Make use of inheritance in this problem.

Define a FixedAccount class containing the method, calculateInterest(), which calculates the interest on the balance for a fixed account.
In addition, extend the FixedAccount class and override the calculateInterest() method to calculate the interest for the savings account.
The interest rate for the fixed and savings account are different.
Compound Interest = Amount – Principal

Where

Amount, A = P(1+(r/n)^nt

Here, P = principal

r = rate of interest

t = time in years

n = number of times interest is compounded per year

The compound interest formula is given below:
Compound Interest = Amount – Principal
Where the amount is given by:
A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}
P = Principal
r = Annual nominal interest rate as a decimal
n = Number of compounding periods
t = Time (in years)
For example, If Mohan deposits Rs. 4000 into an account paying 6% annual interest compounded quarterly, and then the money will be in his account after five years can be calculated as:
Substituting, P = 4000, r = 0.06, n = 4, and t = 5 in A = A = P(1 + r/n){nt}, we get A = Rs. 5387.42, I = 1387.42
