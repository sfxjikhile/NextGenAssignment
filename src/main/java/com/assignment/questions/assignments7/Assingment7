Assignment
Consider the scenario of the EmployeeDetails application. In this application,
David needs to implement user-defined exceptions for the following cases:
If the menu input entered by the user is less than 1 or greater than 3,
an appropriate message should be displayed to the user and the application must restart.
The employee id entered does not start with the alphabet “e”.


Sammy is a programmer at NewAxis Technologies. He needs to write a program, which will accept the employee details from a user. A user should be able to enter the name, contact details, and age.
The minimum and maximum ages are 20 and 55, respectively. If the age of an employee is less than 20 or greater than 55,
a user-defined exception should be thrown. Help Sammy to perform this task.


Create a program to divide two numbers. The program should provide the functionality,
such that if a user tries to perform the division operation by 0, the program should terminate with a customized message.
